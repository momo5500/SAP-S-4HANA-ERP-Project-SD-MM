# SAP-S4HANA-ERP-Analysis

## SAP S/4HANA ERP Analysis – Business Analytics Portfolio Project

---

## Introduction

This project explores the fundamentals of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) through a
hands-on simulation using SAP S/4HANA.

The objective is to understand how integrated ERP systems support core business operations
such as sales, procurement, inventory management, and finance, while enabling
data consistency and informed decision-making.

The project was completed as part of my Business Analytics exchange program at
Loughborough University (UK) and reflects a realistic business scenario rather than
a purely technical SAP exercise.

## Project Context

The case study is based on **Loughborough Bikes Inc. (LBI), a mid-sized international
manufacturing company operating in the United States and Germany.

The company is transitioning from fragmented legacy systems to a modern ERP solution
in order to:

- improve operational efficiency  
- reduce data inconsistencies  
- enhance coordination across departments  

This project combines strategic ERP analysis with practical SAP process execution.
